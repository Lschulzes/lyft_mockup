            <h4>Lyft Insurance Protection</h4>
            <p>Lyft provides additional insurance policies, at no cost to the driver. We worked with leading insurance
              carriers to provide various coverages including: commercial auto liability insurance up to $1M per
              occurrence, contingent comprehensive and collision insurance for drivers who carry comprehensive and
              collision coverage on their personal auto policy, and coverage for bodily injury caused by
              uninsured/underinsured motorists when you are engaged in a ride. If you already carry commercial insurance
              or personal coverage providing specific coverage for ridesharing, Lyft’s policy will continue to be excess
              to your insurance coverage. Please note, the above coverage may be modified to comply with local
              regulations or state laws. Our policy is available in all states in the U.S., except for those rides
              originating in New York City with a TLC (Taxi and Limousine Commission) driver. <a href="#">Get
                information about our insurance policies.</a></p>

            <h4>Passenger Ratings</h4>
            <p>Drivers rate passengers after each ride, so you’ve always got a say. We also require passengers to
              provide valid credit card information for identity verification purposes.</p>

            <div class="content">
              <p>We’re monitoring the COVID-19 situation closely, and taking action based on guidance from the Centers
                for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the World Health Organization (WHO), and local and federal
                officials. <br><br>

                We remain operational across North America except in a select few locations where we've received

            <div class="content">
              <p>Typically, filling out basic information (like your mobile phone number, driver’s license, and other
                documents) takes less than 30 minutes. Then a few more things need to happen:
                <br><br>
                Vehicle Inspection: If you’re using your own car, it will need to pass a Lyft inspection to make sure
                it’s road-ready. We’ll help you find a location and schedule an appointment.
                <br><br>
                Background check: Safety is our top priority, so we’ll need to run a background check to review your
                driving history. This can take a few days to be completed.
